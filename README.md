# ArkWeb-explainers
This repository is for explainers outlining potential new requirements, features, or improvements for the web platform from ArkWeb community, with the goal of contributing to the W3C standardization process. 
These explainers are created by members of the ArkWeb technology community and are intended as open invitations for community feedback and discussion.
Each explainer typically begins by identifying a gap or limitation in today’s web experience, followed by preliminary ideas or design directions that could address the issue. The content is expected to evolve significantly as ideas mature, feedback is incorporated, and use cases are better understood.
Explain­ers that gain broader support and clearer technical direction may later be transitioned into formal incubation venues, such as W3C Community or Working Groups, for further refinement and potential standardization. Inactive or deprecated proposals will be archived but remain accessible for reference.
ArkWeb is a collaborative space, and the presence of an explainer does not imply consensus across all contributors or endorsement by any specific standards body. Instead, it reflects the beginning of a shared exploration of how the web can evolve to better serve users and developers.
We welcome thoughtful contributions, questions, and feedback from across the web community.
